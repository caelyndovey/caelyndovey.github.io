			<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
		</div>

		<p>I am a San Francisco born creator, connector, and communicator in my senior year at Tufts University. I’m pursing a double major in computer science and cognitive brain sciences, which has instilled my people-oriented perspective: I study how people think, make decisions, and what makes them love a product… this is the product I aspire to build. In my free time, I enjoy playing with my golden retrievers, playing guitar & writing songs, and searching for the best sushi in Boston and SF. </p>
